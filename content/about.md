Hi there! My name is Kevin and I grew up in Los Angeles not really knowing how we source our food. After moving to Tucson, Arizona, I became inspired by water harvesting, permaculture, and all things sustainability related. This is a site where I hope to share ideas and movements to help us develop a deeper understanding of how important nature is to our lives.
